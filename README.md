A terminal style website for Ethan Post, forked from [M4TT72 | Terminal](https://term.m4tt72.com)

![screenshot](/public/screenshot.png)

The idea is to rebuild Ethan's website, https://ethancpost.com/, into something more inline with his love of Linux and EMACS. Where the Terminal repo from M4TT72 is a great starting point to this project, there is much to do in order to get all the content converted over in such a way that he can still make new Notes and Blog Posts directly out of EMACS. I also have some issues with the styling choices (lists will stretch indefinitely with no word wrap) that need to be addressed.

## Quick Start

### Using npm

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
